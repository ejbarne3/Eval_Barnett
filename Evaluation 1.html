		<h1>Evaluation 1</h1>
		<a href="https://library.uncg.edu">UNCG Library Website</a>
			<p>For this assignment, an evaluation has been completed on UNCG's Library Website.</p>
		<h2>Components of the Website and Comments</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Headers</strong></li>
				The header of the library’s website is nice, with the image of the library, however, it is difficult to read “university libraries” in white being overlaid on the image.</p>
			<li><strong>Search Box</strong></li>
				The search box is prominent, though it is cluttered by “databases”, “journal a-z list”, “research guides by subject”, and “course reserves”. It seems that the search box should be reserved for the searching function.</p>
			<li><strong>Navigation</strong></li>
				Assuming it’s the navigation, the row of words that has “libraries & collections”, “services”, “spaces”, and “about us” seems out of place which makes it difficult to know it’s the navigation. The fact that it’s below the header and search box is not where I would expect it to be. I would expect it to be at the top if it were that important, or at the bottom if it’s less important.</p>
			<li><strong>Content</strong></li>
				The content seems cluttered. My eyes go everywhere when I’m on the library’s main page. There are so many different colors and different sizes of texts and links and the flow does not seem to be apparent. Additionally, if users explore the site, you will find the following pages to be dry. For example, click on “about us”, you get a page of links, a video, and an image of the library that seems to be on multiple pages. Another example, at the bottom of the page, click “borrow, renew, and order materials”, you get another page of links, and an image. Click on one of those links, you might end up to a page with more links.</p>
			<li><strong>Images</strong></li>
				As mentioned above, some of the images may be used more than once. Additionally, the use of images aren’t incorporated well into the space to complement the text. Images seem to be more of space fillers (unless you’re reserving a room which shows the room being reserved). </p>
			<li><strong>Links</strong></li>
				Links are the go-to tool for the library’s website. While they lead to important information, the placement and importance of the links could be improved upon. For example, I would prefer “borrow, renew, and order materials” be in a more prominent location than the spotlight, which is also mentioned below. However, “department listings & staff directories” seems to be fitting for the bottom of the page as it is less relevant than the other links on the page.</p>
		</ul>
		<h2>Tasks and Ease to Complete on the Website</h2>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Searching</strong></li>
				The search box availability at the top of the website in red, does allow users the ease to search the catalog by ease of finding where to search. It is most prominent when visiting the website. The actual task of searching is not as easy or clear. For example, if the user does not select, “catalog” and searches “all” instead, results will populate from everywhere and all libraries.</p>
			<li><strong>Chat with a librarian</strong></li>
				Again, being located at the top of the website in red, does call attention to the box to where you can clearly see the words, “chat with a librarian”. When you click on it, it brings up all the ways that you can chat with a librarian, including a chatbox which indicates availability. </p>
			<li><strong>Get research help</strong></li>
				The location at the top of the website in red with the words, “research help” is clear and to the point. It would be expected that when I click the link, I will be directed to a page that will help me with my research. The link does in fact take me to a page which is broken into different subjects that might better assist me in my research.</p>
			<li><strong>Reserve spaces and equipment</strong></li>
				First, it should be noted that there are two ways to complete this task that are side by side (image below). This adds clutter. Both ways to complete the task go to the exact same page. Whichever is chosen, there is a clear description of each room. The page seems to be lacking images and the picture of the library does not seem fitting for reservations (especially being the same image in the header). </p>
				<p><img src="uncgtechreservation.gif" alt="UNCG Technology Reservations" title="UNCG Technology Reservation"/></p>
			<li><strong>Read updates</strong></li>
				Items of “spotlight”, “blogs & social media”, and “news & events” are easy to find as they are in a gray box separate from the rest of the site. While it might be easy to find and access this aspect of the site, the relevance compared to its suggested importances are not congruent. First, the three different components of the updates seem like they could fit into one page rather than 3 separate as updates in general. Secondly, if a student is accessing the site for library needs such as research or to renew a book, this huge block of information is irrelevant. Especially since “borrow, renew and order materials” is a tiny link at the bottom of the page. I would imagine more emphasis could be placed on the needs of the user rather than updates that may be overlooked.</p>
