	<h1>An Analysis of UW-Madison Libraries' Search Box Feature using Hick's Law</h1>
		<button type="button" class="collapsible">An Overview of the Feature</button>

			<h2>A Quick Look at the Feature</h2>
				<p>The evaluation will be based on the search box feature found on <a href="https://www.library.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">UW-Madison Libraries'</a> website.
				<p>Upon entering UW-Madison Libraries’ website, I am immediately drawn to the search box from the color contrast of the light background and dark search box. As I am examining the search box, I notice some functions that I myself have not come across in other library search boxes, at least knowingly. The search box has a dropdown navigation menu of format options to which a user may search. There’s the search box, with a description of what to search, where users type in what they are searching for. What I have not come across before was that depending on the format selection made in the dropdown navigation menu, other options will appear below the search box, such as limiters and others ways to search for the selected format.</p>
				<p>The search box feature is important as it provides a way for users to be able to search amongst numerous collections found at the library. Without the search box, a user would have to go to the catalog or search in each database.</p>

			<h2>Background Information on Hick's Law</h2>
				<p>Hick’s Law is named after William Edmund Hick, who worked with Ray Hyman (Hick’s Law is also known as Hick-Hyman Law), to explore the relationship between time and “stimuli present” (Hick's Law, n.d.). The time it takes to process information can be known as the “rate of gain of information” (Hick’s law, n.d.). The “rate of gain of information” was developed by Hick (1952) based off the findings of Merkel in 1885, to whom was identified as an influencer to the “reaction-time era” relevant to Hick’s Law today. Hick’s (1952) original paper is important to researching the topic as it gives an opportunity to understand the concepts from Hick’s point of view. According to the Laws of UX (2019), Hick’s law explains the phenomena that occurs regarding the time it takes to make a decision. The more choices there are, the more difficult a decision will be to make. Proctor and Schneider (2018) reviewed Hick’s Law and apply it to UX, suggesting that applying Hick’s Law to UX makes choices easier. An updated review, and not a case study, of Hick’s Law from another perspective provides insights that may have not been considered in the past (especially with UX). It should also be noted that while many of the laws at the Laws of UX share similarities, Murphy (2018) has clear images and explanations to display the different components of laws such as Hick’s, Fitt’s and Miller’s Law. It provides clarity to what each law looks like in practice.</p>
			<h2>Processing Information</h2>
				<p>Having background information on Hick’s Law, exploring the topic of cognitive overload is beneficial to the topic. Yablonski (2015) raises awareness of the factors that influence cognitive overload. Factors include: too many choices, too much thought required, or lack of clarity (Yoblonski, 2015). While the article was originally suggested for another law at the Laws of UX, this article relating to cognitive overload is important to Hick’s Law because Hick’s Law reduces the cognitive overload by minimizing the amount of choices a user has. Not only is the number of choices important to Hick’s Law, but the response time is equally as important (Nikolov, 2017).</p>
			<h2>Library Anxiety</h2>
				<p>Library anxiety is an important consideration when considering the use of Hick’s Law on a library’s website. Library anxiety has to do with the user feeling like they lack necessary skills to perform research and can even go as far as feelings associated with the physical library itself (Nunes, 2016). While Nunes (2016) addresses ways to reduce library anxiety in the physical library, the application of Hick’s Law on a library’s website can also reduce library anxiety in a digital aspect.</p>

			<h2>Search Box Feature Analysis with Hick's Law</h2>
				<p>Knowing the importance of using the library’s website (taught in a class visit from a librarian), a student goes to the UW-Madison Libraries’ website to perform research for an upcoming assignment. Anxiety about the library may vary based on the student, but could range from self-doubt in research abilities to fear of entering the building all together (Nunes, 2016). The student performing the research manages to get to the library’s website and is immediately drawn to the search box feature. Intentional or not, the search box feature fits the phenomenon as described by Hick’s Law.</p>
				<p>Unsure of what to search, the student clicks the dropdown navigation menu, displaying only five choices (articles, catalog, databases, journal, and UWDC) (Library, n.d.). Each choice has a description of no more than seven words. Suggested by Nikolov (2017) to keep choices between one and five, the library’s website has done just that in its search box feature. As mentioned by Murphy (2018) the use of navigation allows designers to reduce the number of choices a user has, which in turn prevents the user from having a difficult time choosing an option.The library’s search box feature follows Hick’s Law by keeping the choices to a minimum, reducing cognitive overload.</p>
				<p>Cognitive overload isn’t the only issue addressed by Hick’s Law, response time is also addressed in Hick’s Law. The fewer choices there are, the less time a user will spend trying to make a choice. A student using the search box feature on the library’s website is not going to want to spend a lot of time searching for what they need to complete an assignment. By keeping the dropdown navigation menu choices to a minimum, the student will have less to choose from which will then reduce the amount of time the student would spend trying to decide which option to choose from.</p>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible">Conclusion and Recommendation</button>
		<div class="content">
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>Hick's Law, when used appropriately can be benefitical. Whether or not the application of Hick’s Law was intentional, it speaks volumes to see it applied in a way that may reduce a student’s library anxiety when engaging in the research process using the library’s website.</p>
			<h2>Recommendation</h2>
				<p>There are no recommendations to be made. Careful considerations should be made should there be a time when choices are added to the dropdown navigation menu in the search box feature as it would add to the number of choices, which could then lead to overload.</p>
