	<h1>Evaluation 2</h1>
	<h2>A Review</h2>
	<div class ="a">
	<p>Implementing a persona, my name is Jane Doe. As an undergraduate student at University of Central Florida (UCF), I have been given an assignment in which I must complete a research paper on a topic of choice with scholarly articles and books. My research topic is the health benefits of coffee. I have not had any library instruction at this point as this is my first assignment but one of my classmates directed me to the library website <a href="https://library.ucf.edu" target="_blank">https://library.ucf.edu</a> as a starting place. Upon entering the site as an undergraduate student, I feel like this is where I need to be to complete my research paper. There are several components to the site that allow the necessary tasks to be carried out as a student trying to complete an assignment.</p>

	<p>Specifically at the site for research, I can tell I’m at the library’s site because of the clear site identity in which, “UCF Libraries” is prominent in the top banner. I see next to the site identity, there is a site hierarchy, which includes find, services, about, help, and my account. I also notice the different ways that I can get in touch with the library, while it’s not clear that I would be contacting a librarian, I at least know there are different ways to ask the library a question. Here, I can also see the hours. I don’t think I need to ask a librarian quite yet as the search box looks like it might be useful.</p>
    <p>I notice the search box will allow me to do a quick search for various formats. I’m torn whether or not to use the search box or the find button from the site hierarchy, but I go ahead and search, “health benefits of coffee” in the quick search. I get more than 6,000 results but notice at the top of the results is a quick description of coffee that offers me subject terms such as, coffee, beverages, and coffee beans. These aren’t really helpful for what I’m looking for, so I’m ignoring them. Doing a quick scroll, these results seem fitting for what I need. There are a variety of formats available, but I’m specifically looking for articles and books so I refine my search to books, journals, as well as change my date to the last 10 years as I am hoping for currency. I still have 2,000 results so I narrow the language to English and the subject down to coffee and health to where I have just over 600 results. The refining process was straightforward which led me to relevant information for my research paper.</p>

	<p>As a student only visiting the site to conduct research, nothing else seemed to be valuable to me at that point, though it seems worthwhile other components of the site. Shortcuts are made available in the form of icons for computer availability, technology lending, textbook lending, study rooms, and printing. The icons and simplicity of the words clearly tell me what will happen if I click on the icons or words. Towards the bottom is content promo and other timely content with news updates and events. This might be helpful if I were more involved with the library as a student. At the very bottom of the site is a footer navigation for other ways to find, use services, information about the library, help, and social media.</p>
    <p>Overall, UCF’s library website was useful, learnable, memorable, effective, desirable, and delightful (Krug, 2014). It was useful because I was able to access the materials I needed to complete my assignment. It was learnable because I knew where to click and if not, I knew that I could ask someone for help because the “ask us” content was right next to the search box I was using. It was memorable because of the bright colors. It was effective because I was able easily search for resources regarding my topic using the search box with different search options available. I could narrow my results down to just over 600 results to where I could identify articles and books to complete my assignment. It was desirable because I felt like I was getting results from a reliable source. It was delightful because I didn’t experience any issues -- no error messages.</p></div>
